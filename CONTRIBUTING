## Design philosophy
drone-heroku-deploy-container is designed with the following philosophy in mind, any feature\pull requests will be judged against the following:

* Follow Linux philosophy and have each component do one thing & one thing only.
* Reliability is more important then shiny new features.

### Documentation

prior to making any pull requests

* Bug fixes / feature requests - anything off github issues lists
* Submitting tickets - even if you don't have the time\knowledge to fix a bug just opening a github issue about it will greatly help
